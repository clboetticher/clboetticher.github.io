I’m a former R&D strategy consultant and researcher now working in Natural Language Processing for ExxonMobil’s Data Science team. Since earning master’s degrees in Latin American History and Information Science from the University of Texas at Austin, and (in 2021) Data Science from Northwestern University, my research and career trajectory has explored the intersections of language, communications, technology, and design.

Five years ago, I moved from the comfort of skills I’d grown to rely on - research and writing, primarily - to design and support software systems people use to analyze and derive meaning from text. I voluntarily took a position as a newb with some subject matter expertise on an Analytics team and have never looked back. From there I moved to a Data Science team at ExxonMobil applying machine learning to a variety of tough areas, from competitive intelligence to venture research. Managing the delicate (not always elegant) balance between graduate school and a relatively-new assignment (and life these days), I’m learning the ins and outs of framing machine learning problems effectively when circumstances change every day and data are anything but pretty. I mainly work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects in text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Thanks to graduate coursework, I’m diving into deep learning applications for NLP as well, learning how to implement, train, and debug various neural networks for tackling text. Beyond data exploration and experimentation across projects, which I love, I’m learning how to effectively deploy models. Though this is no small feat in a large, global company with numerous production environments, I’ve channeled past-life experience in UX research to ensure models stay relevant and make sure people get the most out of the data products our team develops.

Outside of work I’m enjoying a couple personal NLP projects, one involving Outkast lyric analysis (coming soonn) and another developing neural language models for text generation (see phase 1 in my [Deep Learning portfolio](https://github.com/clboetticher/DeepLearning). Otherwise I’m likely reading Murakami, watching old Parks and Rec episodes, or enjoying a Negroni.
