TEXT

Outside of work I’m enjoying a couple personal NLP projects, one involving Outkast lyric analysis (coming soonn) and another developing neural language models for text generation (see phase 1 in my [Deep Learning portfolio](https://github.com/clboetticher/DeepLearning). Otherwise I’m likely reading Murakami, watching old Parks and Rec episodes, or enjoying a Negroni.
