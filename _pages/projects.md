I have had the good fortune of working on a wide variety of machine learning projects, both personally and over the course of my graduate program at Northwestern. This page contains project overviews by subject, with links to code and analyses.

My complete portfolio can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/clboetticher/). 

### Data Cleaning

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Storytelling

### Regression

### Classification

### Unsupervised Learning/PCA

### Natural Language Processing

### Computer Vision

### What's next
I have two remaining courses in my program - Natural Language Processing (a deep dive to round out my work with the theoretical foundations) and Modeling for Supervised Learning (looking forward to reconnecting with R). This summer, I will be working with a good friend/journalism professor from the University of Houston on Black Lives Matter protest coverage in social media and am also finishing up a long-running Outkast lyric analysis project. More on those soon...
