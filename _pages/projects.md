I have had the good fortune of working on a wide variety of applied statistics and machine learning projects over the course of my graduate work. This page highlights a few of my favorites, with links to the original post, where I wrote one.

My complete portfolio can be found in my repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/clboetticher/).
